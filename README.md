# LearnRust
I am going to learn Rust and document my learnings here

#Note

1. Rust follows snake case naming pattern for files and variables.
2. Every statement in Rust must end with semicolon.
3. "Cargo" is the package manager.
4. Use "cargo build" command to compile the code and convert it into machine level code.
5. Use "cargo run" command to build and run the application.
